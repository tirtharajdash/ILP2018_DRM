### ILP2018_DRM
Large Scale Assessment of Deep Relational Machines (DRM) - Classification and Regression

Submitted to International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) 2018, Italy

#### Codes will be made available after acceptance (ofcourse, after it gets accepted; may not be available if the paper is rejected. We may need to improve over it.).


#### Classification

Uses Datasets used in Lifted Relational Neural Network (LRNN) Study by G. Sourek et al. @ NIPS 2016

1. Prolog Facts (atom,bonds, functional groups, and rings, and targetets)
2. Arff files

#### Regression

Uses 50 QSAR datasets from ChEMBL (Randomly picked 50 datasets from study by I. Olier et al., Meta-QSAR, Machine Learning Journal, 2018)

1. Prolog facts (atom, bonds, functional groups, rings, targets)
2. Arff files

#### Shell scripts

The shell scripts (sh or bash) were used for various purpose in the experiments. You may choose not to use them. These are just for backup for myself.


##### Note: 
There may be some duplicates in pl files. 
You can choose to ignore them or remove them if you wish. Unix command: cat filename | sort -u > /tmp/file && mv /tmp/file filename
